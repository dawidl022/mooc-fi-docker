On an existing project where I previously made a `Dockerfile` to containerize my server, I added a postgres database container integration in a `docker-compose.yml` file. Now by running just the `docker-compose up` command, the database is initialized, followed by the server, and they communicate with each other on the network set up by docker-compose. I used environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` to set up the configuration for the database and the server.
